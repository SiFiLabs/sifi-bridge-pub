## CLI

The SiFi Bridge CLI is currently closed-source. The official releases are exposed on this repository in the Releases tab.

For CLI usage, use `sifibridge --help` to see available options and subcommands.

For REPL usage, use `sifibridge -p` followed by `>>> help` to see the REPL commands help page.

## Python wrapper

A freely available Python wrapper is available both on [GitHub](https://github.com/SiFiLabs/sifi-bridge-py) and on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sifi-bridge-py/).

## Troubleshooting

- At the first launch on MacOS devices, you may see a popup stating: "sifibridge cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified". To fix this (MacOS Sequoia), go into System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Scroll to "Security" -> Allow sifibridge
